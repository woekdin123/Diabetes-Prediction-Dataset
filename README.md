# Diabetes-Prediction-Dataset
Overview
This dataset contains 100,000 records of patient health data related to diabetes prediction. It includes demographic details, medical history, and laboratory test results. The dataset can be used for statistical analysis and machine learning applications for diabetes risk prediction.

Data Description
The dataset consists of 17 columns, with a mix of numerical and categorical data. Below is the description of each column:

Column Name	Description
year	Year of data collection
gender	Gender of the patient (Male / Female)
age	Age of the patient (in years)
location	Geographical location of the patient
race:AfricanAmerican	Indicator variable (1: African American, 0: Otherwise)
race:Asian	Indicator variable (1: Asian, 0: Otherwise)
race:Caucasian	Indicator variable (1: Caucasian, 0: Otherwise)
race:Hispanic	Indicator variable (1: Hispanic, 0: Otherwise)
race:Other	Indicator variable (1: Other races, 0: Otherwise)
hypertension	Hypertension history (1: Yes, 0: No)
heart_disease	Heart disease history (1: Yes, 0: No)
smoking_history	Smoking history (never, former, current)
bmi	Body Mass Index (BMI)
hbA1c_level	HbA1c blood test level (glycated hemoglobin level)
blood_glucose_level	Blood glucose level (mg/dL)
diabetes	Diabetes diagnosis (1: Yes, 0: No)
clinical_notes	Additional medical notes on patient history and recommendations
Potential Use Cases
Diabetes Risk Prediction: Develop machine learning models to predict diabetes risk.
Statistical Analysis: Understand correlations between features like age, BMI, and diabetes.
Healthcare Research: Investigate the impact of factors like race, smoking, and heart disease on diabetes.
